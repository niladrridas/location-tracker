# Design Documents

## 1. System Architecture

### Overview
The Location Tracker system is designed to track the real-time location of devices using various location tracking technologies such as GPS, Wi-Fi, and cellular triangulation. The system consists of several components including the mobile app, backend server, and database.

### Components
1. **Mobile App**: Allows users to view their current location and track their movements in real-time.
2. **Backend Server**: Receives location data from mobile devices, processes it, and stores it in the database.
3. **Database**: Stores location data for all tracked devices.

### Data Flow
1. The mobile app sends location updates to the backend server at regular intervals.
2. The backend server receives the location updates, processes them, and stores them in the database.
3. Users can view their location history and track their movements using the mobile app.

## 2. Database Schema

### Tables
1. **Devices**
   - device_id (Primary Key)
   - device_name
   - device_type
2. **Locations**
   - location_id (Primary Key)
   - device_id (Foreign Key)
   - latitude
   - longitude
   - timestamp

### Relationships
- One-to-Many relationship between Devices and Locations (One device can have multiple locations)

## 3. User Interface Design

### Mobile App Interface
- **Map View**: Displays the current location of the user and their location history.
- **Tracking Controls**: Allows users to start/stop location tracking and adjust tracking settings.
- **Location History**: Shows the user's location history on a timeline.

### Web Interface (Optional)
- Provides a web-based interface for administrators to view and manage location data.

## 4. Security Considerations

### Data Encryption
- Location data transmitted between the mobile app and backend server is encrypted using SSL/TLS.
- Database encryption is implemented to protect stored location data.

### User Authentication
- Users are required to log in to the mobile app using their credentials to access location tracking features.
- Role-based access control is implemented to restrict access to sensitive features.

## 5. Performance Considerations

### Scalability
- The system is designed to handle a large number of concurrent users and devices.
- Horizontal scaling is implemented to distribute the load across multiple servers.

### Real-time Updates
- Location updates are processed in real-time to provide users with accurate and up-to-date location information.
