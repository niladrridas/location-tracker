# Project Requirements

## Overview
The Location Tracker project aims to develop a system for tracking the geographic location of devices in real-time. This document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for the project.

## Functional Requirements
1. **Device Tracking**
   - The system should be able to track the location of registered devices.
   - Location updates should be captured at regular intervals.
   - The system should support tracking both indoor and outdoor locations.

2. **User Management**
   - Users should be able to register and manage their devices for tracking.
   - User authentication and authorization mechanisms should be implemented.

3. **Location Data Storage**
   - Location data collected from devices should be stored securely in a database.
   - The system should support querying location data based on device ID and time range.

4. **Data Visualization**
   - The system should provide visual representations of location data, such as maps and charts.
   - Users should be able to view historical location data for individual devices.

## Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Performance**
   - The system should be able to handle a high volume of location data.
   - Response times for location queries should be fast and consistent.

2. **Scalability**
   - The system architecture should be scalable to accommodate an increasing number of devices and users.

3. **Security**
   - Location data should be encrypted both in transit and at rest.
   - Access to location data should be restricted based on user roles and permissions.

4. **Reliability**
   - The system should be highly available and resilient to failures.
   - Mechanisms for data backup and disaster recovery should be implemented.

## Constraints
1. **Technological Constraints**
   - The system should be developed using Python programming language.
   - Use of third-party libraries and frameworks should be minimized to reduce dependencies.

2. **Regulatory Constraints**
   - The system should comply with relevant data privacy regulations, such as GDPR.

## Assumptions
1. **Device Connectivity**
   - It is assumed that devices being tracked have internet connectivity to send location updates to the server.

2. **User Interface**
   - The system will primarily be accessed via a web-based user interface.

## Dependencies
1. **Python 3.x**
2. **SQLite Database**
3. **Flask Web Framework**
4. **GeoPy Library for Geocoding**
